> Hi! I'm Bongo the Cat! <br>
> I'll be a little cute companion that lives on your screen somewhere. <br>
> You can resize me by just dragging on the border. <br>
> And move me around to wherever you'd like! <br>
> If you hover over me, I'll dim a bit so you can see behind me. <br>
> And if you don't want to see me 😭 you can click me and hit Q! (but please don't!!!!) <br>
> Available for Mac and Windows, Linux coming soon :)


### MacOS Accessibility/Permissions

On Mac, you'll need to give Bongo some permissions to run; there's a quick video guide below. On first run, it should already take you to this page and ask you for the right permission, but you'll want to give Bongo both the Accessibility permission and the Input Monitoring permission. I PROMISE it doesn't keylog you! Even the keys themselves that Bongo presses are just random; it ONLY checks if you're pressing SOMETHING (you can read the code too)
